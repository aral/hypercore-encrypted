# hypercore-encrypted
Wrapper around [hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) that supports encryption
<br>
**Warning: this is experimental, there certainly are bugs and everything is subject to change! **
<br><br>
For now the whole hyperdrive is encrypted with one AES key (using AES CTR),
later there will be a way to use multiple keys (eg. one per file version)
<br><br>
Any feedback is welcome! I still have to learn much, so don't hesitate to tell me what you think about my work.
